# Frontend to-do
* Add ability to upgrade users from members to mods or admins once backend functions created
* Heroku takes ages to wake up - add loading screen to trigger On Submit that'll tide users over until it loads the backend
* Finish coding out axios request to backend for users table of questions answered correctly
* Break up submit handler; it's too big
