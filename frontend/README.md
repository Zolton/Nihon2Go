# Frontend to-do
* Add ability to upgrade users from members to mods or admins once backend functions created
* Heroku takes ages to wake up - add loading screen to trigger On Submit that'll tide users over until it loads the backend
* Finish coding out axios request to backend for users table of questions answered correctly
* Hide Next Question button unless question answered
* Bug to investigate further: localStorage works fine on localhost, but not created on production/Chrome browswer.  As such, user gets no indication their answer was right or wrong, and browser isn't keeping track of answers
